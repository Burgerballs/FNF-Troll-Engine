# Troll Engine Burgerballs Mod Fork

Hello guys this is me burgerballs, this here is the fork i use for my fnf mods.
As troll engine is already perfect i kinda only needed to change small tiny things to make it easier for me.

I've modified the `install_haxelibs` files, before building you should check them out.

# Added features

This fork has some features that are different to the original or are completely new.

## Interpolated Scroll Velocities

Scroll velocities are a big part of Troll Engine, so thats why this modified version adds two extra events for "Interpolated" scroll velocities.

Basically imagine the Scroll Speed Change event in Psych Engine, but for Scroll Velocity instead, with a set duration.

Because of the way that it works, there is an option in the Options Menu, that allows you to change it's smoothness, if it takes a toll on your computer's RAM.

## Themed Options Menu

I've decided to change the appearance of the options menu to make the design more consistant with FNF, instead of the TGT mod specific design the original has.

## (!!WIP!!) V-Slice Character Support

V-Slice's character format is supported.

Along with this are some small optional changes to the Psych Engine character format. Allowing you to use multiple sparrow atlases.
